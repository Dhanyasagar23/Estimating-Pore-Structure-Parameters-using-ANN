# Estimating-Pore-Structure-Parameters-using-ANN

Abstract:
This research project focuses on developing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach to estimate the Pore Structure Parameters of soil using the Soil Retention curve. The aim is to create a prediction model that can accurately determine the Pore Network Parameters based on experimental data derived from n soil-water characteristic curves. The project is currently in progress and is expected to result in a research paper.

Introduction:
Understanding the pore structure of soil is crucial in various civil engineering applications, such as groundwater flow, contaminant transport, and geotechnical engineering. The Pore Structure Parameters play a significant role in characterizing the soil's hydraulic properties. However, accurately measuring these parameters can be challenging and time-consuming. Therefore, the utilization of machine learning techniques, specifically Artificial Neural Networks, can provide an efficient solution for estimating these parameters.

Methodology:
The research project utilizes an ANN-based approach to estimate the Pore Structure Parameters of soil. The model is trained using a dataset consisting of experimental data obtained from n soil-water characteristic curves. The input features are derived from the Soil Retention curve, which is a widely used experimental method for quantifying the relationship between soil moisture content and suction pressure. The corresponding Pore Network Parameters are used as the target variables for training the ANN model.

Results and Discussion:
The project aims to develop a prediction model that can accurately estimate the Pore Network Parameters based on the given soil-water characteristic curves. The performance of the ANN model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error, root mean squared error, and coefficient of determination. The results will be analyzed, and the implications of the findings will be discussed in detail.
